# API Framework Demo

## Background

This project is an example framework for API testing using Java and REST-assured, using Azure Key vault as a secret store. 

This helps us meet our vision of testing APIs before GUIs, and to use the best tools available.

## Usage

This project is intended to be cloned or used as an exemplar for new projects where API testing is required. 

## Technologies

The project uses:
* Java 8
* Spring
* Maven
* REST-assured
* AssertJ
